# Lasertime-Documentation

The API documentation for the [Lasertime](https://github.com/ntflix/Lasertime) project.

This documentation is designed with the fantastic [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) API client and design tool. It has an `insomnia.json` file inside the `public-html` directory which may be imported into the Insomnia application to modify the documentation.

The `public-html` directory is the web-based documentation, designed to be deployed with Docker (`start.sh` is a quick script for launching a Docker instance of the documentation on port 8082). It was generated with the Insomnia program from the developed specification.

There is a sample deployment located [here](https://docs.api.lasertime.iron59.co.uk/).
